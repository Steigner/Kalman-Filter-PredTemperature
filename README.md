## Kalman Filter Prediction Temperature

Simple implementation of a [Kalman Filter](https://web.mit.edu/kirtley/kirtley/binlustuff/literature/control/Kalman%20filter.pdf) for temperature prediction based on historical and current data. The implementation is based on the C++ language with the [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) compiler and the use of the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library for a faster and clearer implementation.
